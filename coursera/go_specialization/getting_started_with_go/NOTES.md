# GoLang Notes
## _What a cool language!_

## Advantages of Golang
- Code Runs Fast
- Has Garbage Collection
- Simpler objects

## More Notes
- Go is a complied language, but also have Garbabe Collection
- This means the GC can automatically manage memory for you!
- Manual memory management is hard!
- GC is typically only done by interpreters, but go is compiled and does it

## Objects
- Go is object oriented, but it's weakly object-oriented
- Group together data and functions that are related to each other (create user defined types, not just int, float, etc.) , this is object oriented programming.
- Think about an int type, each integer has a type of data and a set of functions you can apply to the data. Object oriented is the same idea, but you can create
your own types (classes).
